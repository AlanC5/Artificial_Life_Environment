Create an artificial life environment.
You should have at least three types of agents:
    Herbivore, Carnivore, Plant
Plants are not moving.
Herbivore eats plants and carnivore eats herbivore.
Each herbivore and carnivore reproduce on a neighbor cell if:
    1. They have enough energy
    2. They are in a certain age
    3. They can find a free cell
Plants can reproduce like carnivore and herbivore or they may reproduce
 by random in different locations.
All creators have energy, maximum life and age.
Movement, reproduction and hunting will reduce the energy.
Energy consumption should be by a random distance from a mean.
    Example: (For uniform distribution with min and max)
    int minHuntEnergy = 1;
    int maxHuntEnergy = 9;
    int energy = 100;
    void hunt()
    {
        // Do things
        energy = energy -
        (int)(Math.random()*(maxHuntEnergy-minHuntEnergy+1)+minHuntEnergy);
        // Do things
    }
Your program should be object oriented and it should have subclass and
 super class.
You may start using the code of artificial agent program.
Your program should run for certain numbers of iterations that is the input.
Your program originally prints everything on the screen on different iterations,
 After sometimes you go to gui on discrete system, then gui on continues system.
