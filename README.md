# Artificial_Life_Environment

This is the final project for the Software Design Lab class. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of Java.
The layout and design of the project is entirely up to the student.

## Project Specification
At the start of the program, a "Environment" object is created. Within the "Environment" object, "Agents" are randomly populated.
The program should run for a specified number of iterations and print the "Environment" after each iteration. 
During each iteration, the agents are expected to perform actions. These actions use energy, which needs to be accounted for.

There are three types of agents:
- Herbivore
- Carnivore
- Plant

Each agent has thier own unique specifications.

##Herbivore
- Moves 1 cell
- Hunts Plants
- Reproduce 

## Carnivore
- Moves 1 cell
- Hunts Herbivore
